I think this ["We are the library"](https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/nc27fv/rescue_mission_for_scihub_and_open_science_we_are/) mission is really cool, and it's inspiring to see what the people supporting it are doing and planning to do.

Here are some excerpts:

> [Alexandra Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan) of Sci-Hub, bookwarrior of [Library Genesis](https://libgen.fun/), [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), and countless unnamed others have fought to free science from the grips of for-profit publishers. Today, they do it working in hiding, alone, without acknowledgment, in fear of imprisonment, and even now wiretapped by the FBI. They sacrifice everything for one vision: Open Science.
>
> Why do they do it? They do it so that humble scholars on the other side of the planet can practice medicine, create science, fight for democracy, teach, and learn. People like Alexandra Elbakyan would give up their personal freedom for that one goal: to free knowledge. For that, Elsevier Corp (RELX, market cap: 50 billion) wants to silence her, wants to see her in prison, and wants to shut Sci-Hub down.
>
> It's time we sent Elsevier and the USDOJ a clearer message about the fate of Sci-Hub and open science: we are the library, we do not get silenced, we do not shut down our computers, and we are many.

> **Final Wave:** Development for an open source Sci-Hub. [freereadorg/awesome-libgen](https://github.com/freereadorg/awesome-libgen) is a collection of open source achievements based on the Sci-Hub and Library Genesis databases. Open source de-centralization of Sci-Hub is the ultimate goal here, and this begins with the data, but it is going to take years of developer sweat to carry these libraries into the future.
