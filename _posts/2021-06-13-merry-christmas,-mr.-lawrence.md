Those moments. They are beautiful, in that cruel war. So is Sakamoto's music.

They are also sad. It's been a while, but I still cannot walk away from the feeling of pale sadness that I took from the movie. 

And my rational part is telling me this: Beautiful things may not last long. But they can also last long. They get turned into memories, or beautiful pieces, like Sakamoto's music, which would always be remembered.
