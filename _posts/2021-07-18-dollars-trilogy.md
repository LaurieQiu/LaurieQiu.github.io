title: Dollars Trilogy
---

Just finished watching *[Dollars Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollars_Trilogy)*. Both the films, which are directed by [Sergio Leone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone), and the music score composed by [Ennio Morricone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennio_Morricone) are impressive.

Found myself get interested in [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)) films and also [Spaghetti Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_Western) after watching this trilogy. I kind of get into this Western movie genre as there's some sort of chivalry in it, which is a bit like [Wuxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia), a very rare idiosyncrasy in today's world. Or maybe it's rare all the time, so we have to find it in the world of movie. 

Dollars Trilogy consists of  *[A Fistful of Dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fistful_of_Dollars)* (1964), *[For a Few Dollars More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_a_Few_Dollars_More)* (1965) and *[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly)* (1966). The film titles are clever, are are the quotes, like: *If you work for a living, why do you kill yourself working?*

Also found [one version](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%84%A1%E5%90%8D%E5%AE%A2%E4%B8%89%E9%83%A8%E6%9B%B2) of the Chinese translation for the film titles interesting: 《獨行俠連環奪命槍》for *A Fistful of Dollars*,《獨行俠江湖伏霸》 for *For a Few Dollars More*, and《獨行俠決鬥地獄門》 for *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*. Got a lot of Wuxia or Western flavor.
