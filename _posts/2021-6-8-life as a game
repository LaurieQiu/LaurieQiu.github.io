I read [an article](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game), several days ago, and some of the ideas kept lingering in my mind: 

> The *Oxford English Dictionary* defines a **video game** as, “A game played by **electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program** on a television screen or other display screen.”
>
> If you’re working remotely from a computer, what you’re doing perfectly fits the definition of a video game. 
>
> Nik Milanovic nailed it:
>
> "Sometimes it's weird to remember that we're all effectively competing to hit the right keys on our keyboards in the right order, and that if we do it for long enough we can buy a house."
>
> Hit the right keys in the right order, make money. Work is just an often boring sub-game within the meta-game.

And this reminds me of Buddhism, which suggests that things are a reflection of your own mind, and there isn't really boundary between you and the everything in the world. More often than not we are just trapped by our own thoughts, our own mind.

I wonder, if I can take it all as a game, or as a reflection of my own thoughts, would I be happier, less stressed, and kinder?
