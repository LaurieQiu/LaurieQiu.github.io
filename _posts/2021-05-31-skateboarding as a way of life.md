I like people who are really into skateboarding, doing it as an expression of their love for life and freedom. They are really bold at pursuing what they like, and expressing it. 

Because I'm really timid myself, I don't dare to skate, and I don't really have the courage to forgo something in exchange for something that I'm really passionate about, and I give myself a lot of reasons not to do this or that. 

This year, I have watched a nunmber of skateboarding videos to chill myself out and hoping they could help me be braver, and hopefully, help me muster up enough courage to overcome my social phobia.

Here are some quotes from the video [The Hill Bombing Skateboarders of San Francisco](https://youtu.be/2d6TBfIZzh0):

> I definitely am trying to stay alive to the best of my ability. But if there's an easier way to, like kill yourself, it's having a nine-to-five and doing that and, like, drinking beer, and going to sleep, and doing it again, like, you're just killing yourself slower. 

But, meanwhile, I also saw a lot of comments below the video reminding skateboarders to wear helmets. Like this one from Jeffrey Speicher: 

> My friend lost half his brain bombing. Very experienced downhill rider. The turning car never saw him. Its been about 20 years since. I think of the guilt the driver must carry. My friends mother who stopped her life to care for him since the day of the accident. And of my friend who's life is forever changed. So stupid not wearing helmets in such an unforgiving pursuit and terrain. I was reckless back then too.

People are very kind. And I wonder if wearing a helmet can be part of the skateboarding culture. It can be the norm and skateboarders can also be bold and cool while wearing helmets. And it also reassures those who care about them. 

Sometimes, we need to get the balance right. 

Also, I'm into skateboarding culture because someone I admire is doing it. I want to be like her. And I hope all is well with her.
