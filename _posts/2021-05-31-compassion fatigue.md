Here's the excerpt from a BBC learning English feature - [Compassion fatigue](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/6-minute-english/ep-210527). I ran into this feature today. 

> Tom emphasises compassion as a habit to be developed, instead of something finite – limited or having a fixed size.

> But such compassionate habits can be difficult to cultivate because they face many headwinds - forces blowing in the opposite direction which stop you moving forward.

> Headwinds such as the rapid news cycle which distracts us from developing compassion and courage. Maybe the answer is to help in whatever ways we can, without becoming hard-hearted – like the volunteers of MSF. 

I've listened to the BBC documentary program on [compassion fatigue](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct1gv6) before, but all I can remember is how humanitarian work may lead to compassion fatigue and learned helplessness in humanitarian workers, which can leave them with mental health problems like depression. I should listen to the program some other time and see what solutions are offered in the program.
