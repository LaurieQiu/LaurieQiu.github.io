Procrasting on what I need to do, I played an interactive game about [anxiety](https://ncase.me/anxiety/), and read the author's [mental health tips & resources](https://ncase.me/anxiety). 

Here's a description of the game: 

> Adventures With Anxiety is about, well, anxiety. 
>
> But I've made this for folks with anxiety disorder, like myself. I hope it can help you see - with humor - how anxiety works. And, just maybe, reduce the fear of fear itself. 
>
> There's also badly-drawn stick figures and a hyperactive wolf. Enjoy!

And the *TL;DR* excerpts of the tips and resources:

> - **Do not fear fear itself.**
> - Pain is a protector.
> - Fear is a guard dog for your needs.
> - **All feelings are imperfect signals about met/unmet needs.**
> - Our fundamental human needs are: physical needs, social needs, "becoming a better person" needs.
> - **Healthy people don't "cope" with emotions, they \*collaborate\* with them. They use "negative" emotions as clues, constructive criticism to improve their lives.**
> - If your fear guard-dog is too hyperactive, don't shoot the dog! Retrain it by forming habits.
> - **Habit = When X, Then Y.**
> - To form habits, have a consistent "When" and simple "Then". Track your progress for ~66 days. One habit at a time.
> - Physical health affects mental health & vice versa. Hardware affects software, software affects hardware.
> - **9 Mental Health Habits for your software & hardware:** Meditation, Journaling, Sleep, Exercise, Eat, Talk with friends, Make new friends, Learning, Practicing virtues.
