## **Phototherapy: A serendipitous discovery**

This comic series is adapted from the article "Sister Jean Ward, phototherapy, and jaundice: a unique human and photochemical interaction" by M J Maisels, which is originally published on *Nature*. 

This series is for educational purposes only.

## Introduction

Jaundice is one of the most common conditions in newborns. Approximately 60% of term and 80% of preterm babies develop jaundice in the first week of life.

The breakdown of red blood cells in the body produces bilirubin, and newborns develop neonatal jaundice because their liver is not mature enough to handle the extra bilirubin, thus causes building-up of bilirubin in their blood.

For most babies, this kind of jaundice will subside naturally within one to two weeks.

But when the bilirubin level is too high or rises rapidly, it can damage the baby's brain. In this case, the baby should go to the hospital for proper treatment, such as phototherapy, also known as “light therapy”.

When it comes to phototherapy, do you know how it was first discovered? And how has it evolved?

## Serendipitous discovery

In 1956, pediatricians at Rochford General Hospital in the UK noticed during a ward round that a premature baby had overall pale yellow skin, with a triangle of skin that was much yellower.

It turned out that Sister Jean Ward had taken the jaundiced baby out into the sun.

**But wait!** **Here's the caveat:**

Only a few weeks later, a jaundiced infant was given an exchange transfusion. The tube containing the blood sample was misplaced. When it was later found on a window sill, it contained far less serum bilirubin than expected. Cremer, a pediatrician at the time, noted that the bilirubin level in the jaundiced serum had decreased when exposed to sunlight.

## Phototherapy studies in various countries

In 1958, pediatrician Cremer and biochemist PW Perryman published their groundbreaking study demonstrating that both sunlight and blue light could lower bilirubin levels in jaundiced newborns. Their homemade phototherapy device consisted of eight 40-W ‘light blue’ fluorescent tubes.

Later the same year, pediatrician Franklin also published his findings showing that bilirubin levels declined in jaundiced infants after phototherapy. However, he stopped using phototherapy because there is no information about the toxicity of the bilirubin released by the action of the light waves and he questioned the actual effects of phototherapy.

Nevertheless, pediatricians in Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and subsequently in Italy, France, and England boldly continued Cremer's experiments. In 1960, Ferreira et al. published their study on 77 jaundiced infants and coined the term "phototherapy".

Following the 1958 publications of Cremer and Franklin, at least 21 papers were published documenting the efficacy of phototherapy in jaundiced newborns.

However, only one of these papers was in English. Because of the language barrier, pediatricians in the United States initially did not know much about phototherapy. Dr. Lucey in the U.S., after the publication of Cremer's findings, said that phototherapy was not scientific and would not work.

The turning point came in the latter part of the 1960s. Lucey attended a meeting in Portugal where he met the young Chilean physician Mario Ferreiro and agreed to have him come to do a neonatal fellowship in Vermont.

Soon after his arrival, the new fellow wondered why there was no phototherapy in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) here, as it had been used for years in Chile. Following this, Lucey asked Ferreiro to look up all the relevant phototherapy references and, through this Chilean doctor's translation, soon realized the importance of this therapy.

Lucey went on to construct a phototherapy device and, in the first randomized controlled trial, demonstrated that phototherapy was effective in preventing hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants. Lucey came to be known as the ‘father’ of US phototherapy

## How phototherapy works

Although there remain concerns about the safety of phototherapy, its simplicity and efficacy have been widely recognized. So how does phototherapy work?

Phototherapy works by isomerizing the bilirubin, thus converting it from fat-soluble to water-soluble that can be excreted in bile or urine without the need for conjugation.

## Contribution of phototherapy

Worldwide, there are about 135 million annual live births. Research has shown that some 0.5% to 4% of term, early term, and late preterm infants receive phototherapy prior to hospital discharge, and an equal number are readmitted for phototherapy after discharge. Assuming that the total worldwide incidence of phototherapy is only about 2%, approximately 2.7 million infants are treated with phototherapy each year, and as many as 119 to 120 million infants may have received phototherapy from 1970 to 2015.

In addition, for infants with severe hyperbilirubinemia, the only effective alternative to phototherapy is exchange transfusion, and the advent of phototherapy has significantly reduced the rate of exchange transfusion, which proves the efficacy of phototherapy.

## Is phototherapy safe?

One study found that subjects examined at age 3 to 30 years, who were treated as newborns with intense blue light phototherapy, had developed increased numbers of melanocytic nevi.

There’s also research showing that phototherapy increases the risk for childhood leukemia and juvenile-onset diabetes, but this has not been confirmed by further studies.

Some neonatal studies have also demonstrated short-term effects of phototherapy such as DNA damage and alterations in cytokine levels. However, studies have also found that children with Crigler-Najjar syndrome who have received daily phototherapy for up to 21 years did not have any abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes and did not develop hyperbilirubinemia.

*Note: Crigler–Najjar syndrome is a rare inherited disorder affecting the metabolism of bilirubin. The disorder results in a form of nonhemolytic jaundice, which results in high levels of unconjugated bilirubin and often leads to brain damage in infants.*

For term, early term, and late preterm infants, there is no evidence that phototherapy prevents them from developing kernicterus. In addition, phototherapy may increase mortality in the smallest and sickest infants, but the reason behind this is not clear yet.

The serendipitous discovery of a nurse sparked continuous research and exploration of phototherapy by clinicians. To date, phototherapy has almost entirely eliminated the need for exchange transfusions and is a simple, inexpensive and effective tool in the management of the jaundiced newborn. (It may not be used in the smallest and sickest infants, however, for reasons that remain to be studied). More research is needed on the benefits as well as the short- and long-term complications of this ubiquitous therapy.
