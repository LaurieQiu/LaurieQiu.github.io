I think translating is also kind of like solving problems. You may come across something that could not be easily translated into another language and have to find a way to get around that.

Here is an excerpt from [a thoughtfully written article](https://gengo.com/translators/resources/avoiding-overtranslation-zh/) :

> As with most things in translation there are no hard and fast rules. The best way to avoid overtranslation is to ensure that you donâ€™t translate character by character: read the whole sentence before beginning to translate, determine the function each character/phrase plays in the sentence as a whole, and, if necessary, translate according to this function rather than the literal dictionary definition. Be ready to adapt your translation strategies to the specific text you are working on.
